A young guy had come to Osho Divine Doors. He had no previous experience attending any meditation retreats or similar before. In the first Dynamic Meditation he attended, he was completely honest and true to himself.

In Dynamic Meditation, after some time, instructions are given to freeze. One has to stop all body movement in the freeze stage.

That young guy, was so truthful, that he fell down in the freeze stage. When he heard freeze, he froze as ordered. He did not even think to balance his body. He just froze. When he fell, I and others in hall, heard a thud sound. He got hurt a little.

For rest of the days, he was joyful and in happy mode. He was talking to girls and telling jokes.

Such is the power of Dynamic Meditation as taught by Osho.
